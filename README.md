# Over The Air service for updating ESP8266

The purpose of this small software is to allow performing Arduino OTA updates mainly for ESP8266 devices.

It was designed to be completely free to host/use for small scale instalations. This is the main reason it uses the Firebase Database. Also the server side code could be deployed on App Engine or on Container Engine.
